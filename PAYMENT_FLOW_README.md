# Payment Confirmation Flow

## Overview

The Payment Confirmation Flow provides a streamlined process for users to select payment methods and confirm payments after booking appointments for vaccinations. This implementation enhances the user experience by providing a dedicated confirmation page after booking, rather than showing payment options on the same page.

## Flow Diagram

User confirms payment details

Payment is created in the system
       ↓
User is redirected to payment history
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Appointment Booking Process

- When a user books an appointment (single vaccine or package), the controller returns a JSON response with success status and redirect URL
- The client-side JavaScript handles this response and redirects to the payment confirmation page
- The redirection includes the appointment ID as a parameter

### 2. Payment Confirmation Page

- The payment confirmation page (`/payments/confirm/{appointmentId}`) shows:
  - Appointment details (child name, vaccines/package, date/time)
  - Payment amount
  - Payment method options (Bank Transfer and Cash)
  - Confirmation buttons

### 3. Payment Process

1. **Bank Transfer Payment**:
   - User sees bank account details
   - User enters transaction ID (optional)
   - User confirms payment by checking a checkbox
   - System records payment with status "PENDING"

2. **Cash Payment**:
   - User acknowledges they will pay in cash at the clinic
   - System records payment with status "PENDING"

### 4. Controllers and Services

- **AppointmentController**: Handles appointment booking and returns redirection URL
- **PaymentController**: Provides endpoints for payment confirmation page, payment creation, and status update
- **PaymentService**: Handles business logic for payment creation and status updates

### 5. Payment History

After payment confirmation, users are redirected to their payment history page where they can see all their payments, including the newly created one.
